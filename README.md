DQLab collaborates with Nelda Ampulembang Parenta, a Senior Data Analyst Logisly , organize a project portfolio that aims to measure **sales performance** using **SQL** programming from a shop which name was disguised as **DQLab Sales Store**.

Since I have finished this project using SQL on their platform, I would like to do it again using python by implementing **pandas** library for **data exploratory**. I will also create a **data visualization** of the obtained data using **matplotlib** library.
